PIL World Index is an open, auditable, and continuously maintained reference index
of country-level public intelligence.

It provides structured, source-linked profiles describing political systems,
economic indicators, demographics, infrastructure, security context, and
institutional capacity. All content is derived from open sources and governed by
transparent editorial standards.

This project is independent, non-governmental, and open-source.

== Purpose

The PIL World Index exists to provide a neutral, descriptive alternative to
legacy country reference products. It emphasizes transparency, source traceability,
and updateability over narrative authority.

Rather than presenting a single institutional viewpoint, the Index is designed
to support analysts, researchers, journalists, educators, and technologists who
require:

* Clearly sourced, auditable country data
* Separation of indicators from contextual analysis
* Explicit documentation of assumptions and limitations
* A structure suitable for both human reading and machine use

== What this is (and is not)

=== This project is:

* Descriptive, not predictive
* Source-linked, not proprietary
* Continuously revisable, not edition-locked
* Designed for scrutiny, reuse, and extension

=== This project is not:

* A policy advocacy platform
* A classified or privileged intelligence product
* A replacement for primary statistical agencies
* A real-time monitoring or forecasting system

== Structure

The repository is organized around a small number of explicit content types:

=== Country profiles

Each country is represented by a structured index file containing standardized
key indicators, followed by a contextual profile that explains conditions,
institutions, and constraints.

Gold-standard exemplar profiles are maintained to define editorial quality and
scope expectations.

=== Organization profiles

International organizations (e.g., NATO) are represented using the same pattern:
an index file for standardized fields and a context file for descriptive analysis.

=== Templates

Reusable AsciiDoc templates define required fields, section structure, and
variable usage to ensure consistency across profiles.

=== Sources registry

All authoritative data sources are documented in a central registry, enabling
verification, substitution, and long-term maintenance.

=== Editorial and schema documentation

Style guides, schemas, and editorial policies are included to make assumptions,
rules, and boundaries explicit.

== Methodology

The PIL World Index follows open-source intelligence (OSINT) principles:

* Preference for primary, publicly available sources
* Explicit citation of datasets and publications
* Separation of quantitative indicators from narrative context
* Clear marking of update dates and release versions

AI-assisted drafting may be used for summarization and synthesis, but the project
does not introduce unsourced factual claims.

== Governance and updates

Content is versioned by release. Updates occur on a best-effort basis and may vary
by entity depending on data availability and global conditions.

Contributions are reviewed for sourcing, tone neutrality, and structural
compliance rather than ideological alignment.

== License and reuse

All original content is released under an open license unless otherwise noted.
Source data remains subject to the terms of the originating organizations.

This project is intended to be forked, adapted, extended, and audited.
