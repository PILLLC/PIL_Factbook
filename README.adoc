PIL World Index is an open, auditable, and continuously maintained reference
index of country-level public intelligence.

It provides structured, source-linked profiles describing political systems,
economic indicators, demographics, infrastructure, security context, and
institutional capacity — designed for transparency, reuse, and scrutiny.

This project is independent, non-governmental, and open-source.

== What this is

PIL World Index is a modern alternative to legacy country reference products.
It treats country information as *infrastructure*, not editorial narrative.

Each entity is represented through:

* **Standardized indicators** (clearly sourced)
* **Contextual analysis** (descriptive, not prescriptive)
* **Explicit relationships** between countries and institutions
* **Versioned releases** with documented update dates

The structure supports both human reading and programmatic use.

== What this is not

* Not a policy advocacy platform
* Not a predictive or forecasting system
* Not a replacement for primary statistical agencies
* Not a real-time intelligence feed

== Repository structure

* `countries/` — Country profiles (index + context)
* `orgs/` — International organization profiles (e.g., NATO)
* `data/` — Relationship registries and structured data
* `templates/` — Canonical templates for consistency
* `scripts/` — Maintenance and normalization utilities

Gold-standard exemplar profiles are included to define editorial and structural
expectations.

== Methodology

The Index follows open-source intelligence (OSINT) principles:

* Preference for primary, public sources
* Clear citation of datasets and documents
* Separation of quantitative indicators from narrative context
* Explicit documentation of assumptions and limitations

AI assistance may be used for synthesis, but unsourced factual claims are not introduced.

== Governance and reuse

Content is versioned by release and updated on a best-effort basis.
Contributions are reviewed for sourcing, neutrality, and structural compliance.

The project is intended to be forked, extended, audited, and adapted.
