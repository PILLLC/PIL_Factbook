Thank you for your interest in contributing. The PIL World Index values clarity,
neutrality, and verifiable sourcing above all else.

This project treats country-level information as infrastructure, not editorial narrative.

== Guiding Principles

* Content must be descriptive, not prescriptive
* Avoid advocacy, opinion, or partisan framing
* Prefer primary, authoritative public data sources
* Every factual claim should be attributable

== Contribution Workflow

. Fork the repository
. Create a feature branch
. Make your changes
. Open a Pull Request (PR) with a clear description of scope and sources

Pull Requests are reviewed on a best-effort basis.  
Review does not guarantee acceptance or inclusion in a release.

All PRs are evaluated for:

* Structural consistency
* Sourcing and citation quality
* Tone and neutrality
* Compliance with the style guide

== Country Profile Structure

Each country profile lives under:

`countries/<country-name>/`

At minimum, this includes:

* `index.adoc` — structured indicators
* `context.adoc` — descriptive context sections

Directory naming conventions and structure should follow existing
gold-standard exemplar profiles.

== Required Metadata

Every country and organization profile must include the following attributes
at the top of each file:

[source,adoc]
----
:iso3:
:iso2:
:wdid:
:last-updated:
:release:
----

== Citations

Use AsciiDoc footnotes for citations:

`Statement here.footnote:[Source name, dataset or table, year, identifier or URL.]`

Numeric values, rankings, superlatives, and time-bound statements must be cited.

== Adding New Sources

If a new source is introduced:

* Add it to `sources/registry.yml`
* Include licensing and attribution notes
* Reference it consistently across content

== What Not to Submit

* Unsourced factual claims
* Editorial commentary or opinion
* Speculative analysis or forecasting
* Content copied from proprietary or restricted sources

== Questions

If guidance is needed, open a GitHub issue labeled `question`.

Responses are provided on a best-effort basis.
