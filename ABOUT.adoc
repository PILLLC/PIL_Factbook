= About the PIL World Index

The PIL World Index is an experiment in treating country information as
public infrastructure rather than as editorial content.

For decades, country reference products have combined facts, analysis,
and institutional perspective into single narratives. While useful,
those formats often obscure sourcing, assumptions, and update mechanics.

The World Index takes a different approach.

== Design principles

The Index is built around a small set of explicit principles:

* **Transparency** — All claims are traceable to sources.
* **Separation of concerns** — Indicators, context, and relationships are distinct.
* **Auditability** — Content can be reviewed, diffed, and versioned.
* **Reusability** — Structured formats support downstream use.
* **Neutrality** — Descriptive analysis without policy advocacy.

== What’s included

Each country profile consists of:

* A standardized index of key indicators
* A contextual narrative describing institutions and constraints
* Explicit links to international organizations and partnerships
* Release metadata indicating currency and scope

International organizations are treated as first-class entities, using the same
structural model.

== Who this is for

The Index is intended for:

* Researchers and analysts
* Journalists and editors
* Educators and students
* Civic technologists and developers
* Anyone who wants a clearer view of how countries and institutions relate

== What this enables

By separating data, context, and relationships, the Index supports:

* Comparative analysis across countries
* Programmatic reuse in tools and visualizations
* Transparent updates as conditions change
* Independent verification and critique

== Status

This repository represents an early but functional MVP.
Gold-standard exemplars define quality and scope expectations.
The structure is stable; content will continue to evolve.

The project is open by design and open to scrutiny.
