== Overview
The population model defines how population-related indicators may be structured,
interpreted, and extended within the PIL World Index. It provides a transparent,
non-predictive framework for organizing demographic inputs and describing how
population change is represented across countries and regions.

The model is descriptive in intent and does not claim to forecast population
outcomes. Where scenarios or projections are referenced, they are explicitly
labeled and sourced.
