  This model documents structure and assumptions only.
  It does not generate predictions.

== Purpose
The purpose of the population model is to provide a consistent structure for
representing population-related indicators across countries in the PIL World
Index. It defines common inputs, assumptions, and limitations to support
comparability and transparency.

== Inputs
Typical inputs referenced by this model may include:
* Total population
* Age distribution
* Fertility rates
* Mortality rates
* Net migration

Input values are sourced from authoritative datasets and are not generated by
this model.

== Structure
The model treats population change as the result of multiple contributing
factors rather than a single trend. No single causal relationship is assumed.
Indicators are recorded independently unless explicitly documented otherwise.

== Scenarios and interpretation
Where scenario-based representations are used (e.g., baseline or stress cases),
they are treated as interpretive tools rather than predictions. Scenario labels
must be explicit and sourced.

== Limitations
* Population data may be revised retroactively by source institutions.
* Migration flows are subject to high uncertainty.
* Subnational variation is not fully captured at the national level.

== Relationship to country profiles
Country profiles may reference this model when presenting population indicators.
The model does not override country-specific data notes or source citations.
